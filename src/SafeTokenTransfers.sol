/**
 * @title SafeTokenTransfers
 * @notice Library for safe token transfers with strict balance validation
 *
 * This library enforces exact balance changes to prevent fee-on-transfer exploits,
 * accounting mismatches, and silent value leakage in vault systems.
 *
 * COMPATIBLE TOKENS (Standard ERC20):
 * - USDC, DAI, USDT (without fees enabled)
 * - Standard wrapped tokens (WETH, WBTC)
 * - Most ERC20 tokens that transfer exact amounts
 *
 * INCOMPATIBLE TOKENS (will revert with TransferAmountMismatch):
 * - Fee-on-transfer tokens (SAFEMOON, USDT with fees, etc.)
 * - Rebase tokens (stETH, aTokens, AMPL)
 * - Elastic supply tokens
 * - Tokens with transfer hooks that modify balances
 * - Any token that doesn't deliver exact transfer amounts
 *
 * USAGE WARNING:
 * Before deploying a vault with a new token, verify that the token:
 * 1. Transfers exactly the specified amount (no fees)
 * 2. Does not rebase or change balances automatically
 * 3. Does not have transfer hooks that modify amounts
 *
 * Test with small amounts first to ensure compatibility.
 *
 * @dev The balance validation check will reject any token where
 * recipientBalanceAfter != recipientBalanceBefore + amount
 */
